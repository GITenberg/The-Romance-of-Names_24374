description: '"My aim has been to steer a clear course between a too learned and a
  too superficial treatment, and rather to show how surnames are formed than to adduce
  innumerable examples which the reader should be able to solve for himself... The
  subject matter is divided into a number of rather short chapters, dealing with the
  various classes and subdivisions into which surnames fall; but the natural association
  which exists between names has often prevailed over rigid classification"--Pref.'
